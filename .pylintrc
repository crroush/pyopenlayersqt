# Disable too-many-lines for comprehensive demo files
# Disable duplicate-code for similar patterns in example files
# Disable invalid-name for Qt method overrides (camelCase required by Qt)
# Disable protected-access for internal API usage (_send, etc.)
# Disable missing-docstring for library code (will be addressed separately)
# Disable broad-exception-caught for intentional generic error handling
# Disable no-self-argument for static method patterns
# Disable arguments-differ for Qt method overrides
# Disable refactoring suggestions (consider-using-max-builtin, etc.)
